Module Planner Web App 

This web application aims to solve the problem of a lack of clarity or possible oversights that students might experience when deciding what modules to take over their course
of their study. The application ensures that students take an optimal semester-wise module plan, that ensures they meet the prerequisites for the programme they desire to take
in their preferred semester.
